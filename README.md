# Inventory-Tracker
Java project created for school

This project uses an online mySQL connection that is no longer connected because it was just up for school and i am graduated. It allows a person to create multiple users in multiple locations and track inventory in them. You can add inventory and move it from location to locations. You can also schedule jobs and get alerts when those are close. It also handles time zones in those locations.
